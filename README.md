# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the miles per gallon (mpg) of the MechaCar prototypes.   The MechaCar prototypes are being developed by AutosRUs and are experiencing production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress.
- Collect summary statistics of the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers and summarize the results.
